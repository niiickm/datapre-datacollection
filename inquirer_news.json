If there are many fishermen out\u2026 they won\u2019t go close to them and will stay away.\u201d\nDragonflies buzz overhead as Rachin points out a shed on the Laos side of the Mekong river that is reported to be storing a ton of yaba tablets.\nHe says his team is busiest in the first hours before dark and the last before dawn. Drug traffickers time their movements with changeovers in the local police force\u2019s shifts.\nThe volunteers do not make arrests because they are unarmed and some drug smugglers have guns.\nBut they do tip off police to the movements of traffickers, as was the case during the last big arrest at a neighbouring village.\n\u201cThe drug-runners carried the packages from their boats and hid the drugs in the grass and trees on the riverbank,\u201d Rachin said.\n\u201cThey sent a car to the spot to collect the drugs. Just as the car was leaving, the police came and arrested them and found five million yaba tablets.\u201d\nDuangphaisri Ninket, who runs an accommodation business in the village, said she feels safer knowing Rachin\u2019s team are keeping watch.\nBut the 54-year-old still worries about meth taking hold in her community.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid if they start selling drugs in my village it will affect the youth. They will become addicts,\u201d she told AFP.",

        "article_body": "\nSEOUL/WASHINGTON North Korea\u2019s claim on Friday that it had launched a new type of tactical short-range ballistic missile highlighted military advances by the nuclear-armed state and propelled it to the top of new U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s foreign policy agenda.\nThe United States condemned Thursday\u2019s launches, which came hours before Biden held his first White House press conference since taking office in January.\nWhen asked if he agreed that North Korea was the top foreign policy issue he faced, Biden replied: \u201cYes.\u201d\nBiden had previously left North Korea entirely out of his maiden foreign policy speech in February, and in outlining eight diplomatic priorities earlier in March, his secretary of state didn\u2019t focus on North Korea except to list it as one of several countries that pose a challenge.\nThe launches, which were North Korea\u2019s first ballistic missile tests in nearly a year, underscored steady progress in its weapons program since denuclearisation talks with the United States floundered under former President Donald Trump.\nBiden said the United States remained open to diplomacy with North Korea despite its missile tests, but warned there would be responses if Pyongyang escalates matters.\nSouth Korea\u2019s President Moon Jae-in called the missile test \u201cconcerning,\u201d saying Seoul, Pyongyang, and Washington should not create hurdles for talks.\n\u201cNow is the time for the South, the North, and the United States to make efforts to continue dialogue. It is never desirable to create difficulties for dialogue,\u201d he told a ceremony commemorating soldiers who fought in clashes with the North in 2002 and 2010.\nNorth Korea had been widely expected to conduct some kind of weapons test in the early months of Biden\u2019s term as a way of signaling its resolve, gaining practical military capabilities, and boosting its leverage should talks resume.\nWhile North Korea\u2019s intentions were not yet entirely clear, Thursday\u2019s tests were relatively restrained, said John Delury, a professor at South Korea\u2019s Yonsei University.\n\u201cThese tests come some time after Biden\u2019s inauguration, and they are still at a low enough level that it gives the administration breathing room,\u201d he said. \u201cRegardless of North Korea\u2019s intentions, however, the effect is to elevate the significance and move it up the administration\u2019s agenda.\u201d\nThe State Department said the launches violated multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions and threatened the region and the broader international community.\nThe new weapon is based on existing technology that was improved to carry a 2.5-ton warhead, KCNA reported.\n\u201cThe development of this weapon system is of great significance in bolstering up the military power of the country and deterring all sorts of military threats,\u201d said Ri Pyong Chol, the senior leader who oversaw the test, according to KCNA.\nPhotos released by state media showed a black-and-white painted missile blasting off from a military launch vehicle.\nMissile specialists at the California-based James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) said it appeared to be a missile that was unveiled at a major military parade in Pyongyang in October.\nKCNA said Thursday\u2019s test confirmed the missile\u2019s capability to conduct \u201clow-altitude gliding leap type flight mode,\u201d a feature that makes such weapons harder to detect and shoot down.\nThe United Nations Security Council North Korea sanctions committee is due to meet on Friday to discuss the missile tests, at the request of the United States.\nThe move suggests a measured response by the Biden administration, as the sanctions committee is comprised of lower-level diplomats from the 15 council members, rather than the ambassador-level council that convened after North Korea fired ballistic missiles a year ago.\nWhile rejecting American overtures, North Korea has also used measured language, insisting it will only return to talks if the United States drops hostile policies.\nAnalysts noted leader Kim Jong Un did not appear to attend the Thursday missile tests, with state media instead showing undated photos of him inspecting new passenger busses in Pyongyang.\nKim has vowed to try to improve living conditions for citizens as North Korea\u2019s economy was ravaged by multiple crises, including international sanctions over its weapons programs, natural disasters, and a border lockdown that slowed trade to a trickle in an effort to prevent a coronavirus outbreak.",

These systems and culture failed you and must change,\u201d said Cardinal Dew.The Royal Commission will make recommendations to the government in its final report later this year.

        "article_body": "\nTORONTO\u00a0 \u2013 As China imposed a sweeping national security law in Hong Kong last year after massive protests, residents of the city moved tens of billions of dollars across the globe to Canada, where thousands are hoping to forge a new future.\nCapital flows out of Hong Kong banks reaching Canada rose to their highest levels on record last year, with about C$43.6 billion ($34.8 billion) in electronic funds transfers (EFT) recorded by FINTRAC, Canada\u2019s anti-money laundering agency, which receives reports on transfers above C$10,000.\nThe previously unreported outflows, the highest since 2012 when the earliest FINTRAC records are available, are the first evidence of a significant flight of capital overseas from the Asian financial hub following the security turmoil.\nOne Canadian lender, Equitable Bank, also told Reuters it had seen a surge in deposits from Hong Kong just after the new law was introduced in June 2020. Critics say the law was aimed at stifling dissent, an allegation denied by Beijing which says it was needed to strengthen national security.\nThe Hong Kong government has said the city has not seen significant capital outflows since the anti-government unrest first began in 2019, when a now-shelved bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China was proposed.\nThe record transfers, up 46% from 2016 and up 10% from 2019, came in a year when Hong Kong police froze the accounts of several people linked to pro-democracy protests, triggering concern among some residents about asset safety.\nThe outflows represent only 1.9% of Hong Kong\u2019s total bank deposits in 2020. But, at the same time, the FINTRAC data captures only a fraction of total legal inflows into the Canadian economy because many transactions are not included, such as transfers via cryptocurrencies, between financial institutions, or under C$10,000, said spokesman Darren Gibb.\nThe agency has seen a steady increase in overall EFT reporting, consistent with global trends, he said.\nAnd it\u2019s not just money.\nReuters interviewed a dozen immigration consultants, lawyers, and real estate brokers who provided a window into how many Hong Kong residents are eager to start a new life in Canada and bring with them millions of dollars, once pandemic-induced travel restrictions end.\nCanadian visa applications from Hong Kong, excluding visitors\u2019 visas, rose 10% to 8,121 in 2020, indicating further capital flows from the city are likely. Britain and Australia are expected to be other favored destinations for Hong Kong residents.\nAndrew Lo, chief executive of immigration consultancy Anlex in Hong Kong, is looking to expand into wealth management services in Canada, which he believes will be \u201ca booming market for new immigrants, especially from Hong Kong.\u201d\nLo said he helped around 36 families emigrate to Canada in the past 12 months, each bringing C$1.5 million on average.\n(For graphic on financial transfers to Canada by Hong Kong residents \u2013 https://graphics.reuters.com/HONGKONG-SECURITY/CANADA2/yxmvjwyeopr/index.html)\nDespite the cash leaving Hong Kong, it continues to receive inflows on a net basis, with total deposits growing by 5.4% in 2020 to HK$14.5 trillion ($1.9 trillion), according to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\u201cAs an international financial center (IFC), Hong Kong handles capital inflows and outflows which arise from all sorts of needs on a regular basis,\u201d a central bank spokeswoman told Reuters in response to the questions about outflows to Canada.\n\u201cThis is just normal in keeping with the nature and function of an IFC.\u201d\nRobust cash flows from mainland China via the Stock Connect initiative and strong demand for some of Hong Kong\u2019s initial public offerings (IPOs) last year have helped capital inflows into Hong Kong, analysts and bankers have said.\nCanada is a second home for many Hong Kong residents after their families moved to the Vancouver and Toronto areas ahead of the British handover of its former colony to China in 1997. After obtaining Canadian citizenship, many returned to Hong Kong, which is now home to about 300,000 Canadians \u2013 one of the largest Canadian communities abroad.\nBut following the 2020 security law, more Hong Kong residents want to make their home in Canada, which took steps https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2020/11/canada-announces-immigration-measures-supporting-hong-kong-residents-and-canadians-in-hong-kong.html late last year to make it easier for them to obtain work permits and permanent residency, according to immigration consultants and lawyers.\nThe residents cite eroding rights and freedoms, and a better education for their children as reasons for their choice, and many are selling their Hong Kong properties and bringing their money with them, they said.\nPolitical developments have prompted people to consider what will happen if things decline, and to look at Canada as an option, said Canadian immigration attorney Evelyn Ackah. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s just an option. I don\u2019t see a mass exodus. It\u2019s people looking around, saying \u2018can I be somewhere else if I need to?'\u201d\n(For graphic on Canada visa applications from Hong Kong \u2013 https://graphics.reuters.com/HONGKONG-SECURITY/CANADA/xegvbgeldpq/index.html)\nEven as departures are delayed by travel restrictions and slower immigration processing times, some have already begun moving money into Canadian accounts, according to immigration experts.\nToronto-based Equitable Bank has seen a \u201cremarkable increase\u201d in balances in existing accounts linked to Hong Kong phone numbers, said Mahima Poddar, group head of personal banking.\nAverage balances in these accounts were up 30% between June and mid-March, versus a 4% rise in accounts with non-Hong Kong phone numbers.\nThe country\u2019s large banks either didn\u2019t respond to requests for, or declined to comment on, any influxes from Hong Kong.\nJean-Francois Harvey, a Canadian lawyer based in Hong Kong who specializes in immigration for high-net-worth individuals, has seen a five-fold increase in clients seeking to move to Canada since mid-2020.

This is a wave.\u201d\nHong Kong-based attorney Clifford Ng, who himself immigrated to Canada in 1975 and returned to Hong Kong in 1995, said he has seen a four-fold increase in inquiries about the tax implications of moving to Canada.\nCanada is not the only destination expected to see inflows from Hong Kong as residents look to leave, though.\nBritain\u2019s government expects that as many as 321,600 Hong Kong residents will migrate there over the next five years, with almost half of those in 2021. Based on this, Bank of America said in January it expects emigration-related outflows to reach HK$280 billion ($36.1 billion) this year.\nSome of the money coming into Canada is likely to flow into real estate, property consultants said.\nIn the first 10 weeks of 2021, Hong Kong hosted nearly a third more exhibitions of new-build properties by Canadian developers than in the same period in 2019, according to data from Eli McGeever, vice president of international property at Soho App.\nExhibitions in 2020 were affected by Hong Kong\u2019s first wave of COVID-19 lockdowns.\nAlisha Ma, founder of immigration consultancy Halcyon Counsel, said Hong Kong families are looking at properties in Toronto and Vancouver, but waiting until they obtain permanent residency to avoid foreign buyers\u2019 taxes.\nKeelan Chapman, founder of the Canadian Real Estate Investment Centre (HK), said he has seen a noticeable increase in buyers looking for larger properties in good school areas for eventual self-use, rather than solely for investment.\nHe said many of his clients, most of whom are Hong Kong residents with Canadian passports, have accelerated timelines for returning to Canada to around five years on average, from around eight years previously.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no rush to move back to Canada tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a long picture view.\u201d\n($1 = 1.2546 Canadian dollars; $1 = 7.7669 Hong Kong dollars)",

        "article_body": "\nCAIRO, Egypt\u00a0 \u2013 The owners of a giant container vessel blocking the Suez Canal said Thursday they faced \u201cextreme difficulty\u201d refloating it, as Egypt temporarily closed one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes.\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi\u2019s advisor on seaports, Mohab Mamish, told AFP late Thursday that \u201cmaritime navigation will resume again within 48-72 hours, maximum\u201d.\n\u201cI have experience with several rescue operations of this kind and as the former chairman of the Suez Canal Authority, I know every centimetre of the canal,\u201d said Mamish, who oversaw the recent expansion of the waterway.\nHowever, salvage experts had warned earlier on Thursday the shut-down could last days or even weeks, potentially forcing businesses to re-route cargo ships around the southern tip of Africa in a blow to global supply networks.\nOn the third day of the crisis, global shipping giant Maersk and Germany\u2019s Hapag-Lloyd both said they were looking into going around Africa.\nThe Suez drastically shortens travel between Asia and Europe. The Singapore-Rotterdam route, for example, is 6,000 kilometres (3,700 miles) and up to two weeks shorter via the canal than going around Africa\u2019s Cape of Good Hope.\nEgypt\u2019s Suez Canal Authority (SCA) said it was doing all it could to refloat the MV Ever Given, a 400-metre (1,300-foot) long and 200,000 tonne vessel that veered off course and ran aground in a sandstorm on Tuesday.\nTug boats, dredgers and heavy earth-moving equipment have been deployed, but so far the ship has not budged.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a heavy whale on the beach, so to speak,\u201d said Peter Berdowski, head of Dutch firm Smit Salvage, which previously worked on the stranded Italian cruise ship Costa Concordia and the sunken Russian nuclear submarine Kursk.\nThe salvage company was deploying a team to the site Thursday to assess what it would take to dislodge the Panama-flagged ship, said Berdowski, CEO of its parent company Boskalis.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to speculate, but it can take days or weeks,\u201d he told Dutch TV news programme Nieuwsuur on Wednesday.\nSatellite pictures released by Planet Labs Inc show the so-called \u201cmegaship\u201d, which is longer than four football fields, wedged diagonally across the entire canal.\nWith ships waiting in both the Mediterranean and Red Sea and in the canal, the SCA announced it was \u201ctemporarily suspending navigation\u201d along the waterway.\nJapanese ship-leasing firm Shoei Kisen Kaisha, the owner of the giant vessel, said it was facing \u201cextreme difficulty\u201d trying to refloat it.\n\u201cWe sincerely apologise for causing a great deal of worry to ships in the Suez Canal and those planning to go through the canal,\u201d it said in a statement.\nA MarineTraffic map showed large clusters of vessels circling as they waited in both the Mediterranean to the north and the Red Sea to the south.\nOil prices had jumped by almost six percent on Wednesday in response to the Suez Canal accident, before dropping again on Thursday.\n\u201cWhat a single vessel can do to the global oil market is remarkable,\u201d said Rystad Energy analyst Bjornar Tonhaugen.\n\u201cThe stuck vessel in the Suez Canal created the visual definition of a supply route bottleneck, effectively disrupting one of the world\u2019s busiest routes for all commodities.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like it before,\u201d said Ranjith Raja, Middle East oil and shipping researcher at financial data firm Refinitiv.\n\u201cIt is likely that the congestion\u2026 will take several days or weeks to sort out as it will have a knock-on effect on other convoys.\u201d\nThe vessel\u2019s managers, Singapore-based Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, said the 25 crew aboard were unhurt and the hull and cargo undamaged.\n\u201cThe ultimate responsibility for the ship\u2019s safety lies with the captain,\u201d former SCA chairman Mamish noted.\nHistoric sections of the canal were reopened Wednesday in a bid to ease the congestion.\nThe Suez is an \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d route, said Camille Egloff, a maritime transport specialist at Boston Consulting Group.\nNearly 19,000 ships passed through the canal last year carrying more than one billion tonnes of cargo, according to the SCA.\nEgypt earned $5.61 billion in revenues.\nCanal traffic has been disrupted several times in the past, notably during the Arab-Israeli wars of the second half of the 20th century.\nIt was closed for six months after Egypt nationalised the canal operating company in 1956, prompting an abortive invasion by Britain, France and Israel.\nMore recently, in 2018, the canal was temporarily closed after a Greek-owned bulk carrier suffered engine failure, triggering a five-ship collision.",

        "article_body": "\nNEW YORK\u00a0 \u2013 New York City plans to deploy an all-Asian undercover police team and expand community outreach in more than 200 languages to combat a rise in hate crimes against Asians, authorities said on Thursday.\n\u201cIf you are going to commit a hate crime in New York City, we will find you,\u201d New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said in unveiling the two-pronged plan to fight bias crimes.\n\u201cWe are not going to tolerate anyone being targeted because of the color of their skin, the religion they worship, their sexual preference or anything else,\u201d Shea said.\nJust days after a spate of assaults on Asian-Americans in New York City last weekend, Shea said he was ramping up the NYPD\u2019s undercover force with plain-clothed officers, all of them of Asian descent. Starting this weekend, they will patrol subways, grocery stores and other locations to stem anti-Asian incidents that total 26 so far this year, including 12 assaults, police said.\n\u201cThe next person you target through speech or menacing activity may be a plain-clothed New York police officer \u2013 so think twice,\u201d Shea said.\nThe 26 incidents so far have resulted in seven arrests, police said. Those incidents included 12 assaults so far this year, three of them last weekend, police said. By comparison, at this time last year, there were no assaults reported against Asian-Americans, police said.\nBecause hate crimes too often go unreported, now anyone dialing 911 can utter a single English word for their native language \u2013 such as Mandarin \u2013 and police operators will help access translators who speak more than 200 languages, police said.\nAdvocates tied the surge in hate crimes to blame that has been placed on the Asian-American Pacific Islander community for the coronavirus spread. The community reported a spike in violence since March 2020, when then-President Donald Trump started repeatedly referring to COVID-19 as the \u201cChina virus\u201d and \u201ckung flu,\u201d which some said inflamed anti-Asian sentiment.\nHate crimes against Asian Americans rose by 149% in 2020 in 16 major cities compared with 2019, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism. Violent incidents included people being slashed with a box cutter, lit on fire and verbal harassment, according to testimony at a U.S. congressional hearing on anti-Asian violence convened this month.\nThe most deadly incident was this month\u2019s shooting spree at three Atlanta area spas that left eight people dead, six of them Asian women. A 21-year-old white man has been charged with multiple counts of murder, and police investigating motives have not ruled out the possibility that the attacks were provoked, at least in part, by anti-immigrant or anti-Asian sentiments.",

        "article_body": "\nEven now, more than two decades after the Columbine school shooting, survivor Heather Martin is trying to learn how to take care of herself.\nShe struggled with her mental health for a decade before seeking professional help. There were dark days and years including intense trauma after the 9/11 attacks. Those struck more than two years after she barricaded herself in a Columbine classroom with 59 other students in 1999.\nMartin, 39, heard about the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks over the radio while driving to work. She has blacked out most of what happened next. She only remembers her coworkers at a restaurant asking why she was hiding behind an ice machine.\nSurvivors of mass shootings like Martin, family members of those who died in those attacks and psychologists agree that people who have experienced violence like the recent killings in Boulder and Atlanta need the care of mental health professionals, not just in the immediate aftermath but for years or decades afterward.\nThe United States lacks that effective and ongoing care. Survivors of mass shootings have stepped in themselves to fill gaps in a system that is a patchwork of local resources not designed to provide sustained response.\n\u201cAll the help in the world is there for the shooting victims right after the event,\u201d Martin said. \u201cBut society quickly forgets and moves on. The victims and their families cannot forget, ever.\u201d\nThirteen years after Columbine, a gunman opened fire in nearby Aurora, Colorado, killing 12 people in a movie theater.\nA few days after that shooting, Martin received a text from a fellow Columbine survivor, Jen Hammer, asking if she wanted to form a support group for shooting victims. She agreed immediately.\n\u201cWe wanted to offer something that we didn\u2019t have access to in 1999 \u2013 peer support,\u201d Martin said.\nIn forming their Rebels Project, Martin and several other Columbine survivors had to confront lingering demons.\n\u201cWe learned that 13 years later we were still struggling \u2013 there was a whole group of us who were still a mess,\u201d she said.\nLike the Columbine survivors, Shiva Ghaed has found mental health support to be lacking.\nGhaed started thinking about the missing support shortly after she survived the 2017 Las Vegas shooting at a packed music festival that killed 60 people and injured nearly 900.\nA San Diego-based clinical psychologist who well before the shooting specialized in PTSD and trauma disorders, Ghaed escaped the Las Vegas shooting without physical injury.\nThe National Center for PTSD has estimated that 28% of people who have witnessed a mass shooting will suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder and about one-third acute stress disorder.\nVirtually all who do suffer PTSD can recover with the proper treatment, the course of which can vary widely depending upon the individual, Ghaed said.\n\u201cAfter I came home following the Las Vegas shooting, I realized, \u2018Oh, my God, I\u2019m not hearing anything about any mental healthcare support for those who were there,'\u201d she said.\nShe immediately formed a weekly support group. Amid the pandemic and other issues, that group has now disbanded. Ghaed continues to seek ways to provide support through her Route 91 Therapy website.\nSandy Phillips, whose daughter Jessica Ghawi was among those killed in the 2012 Aurora movie theater shooting, created the Survivors Empowered group.\nA day after Monday\u2019s shootings in Boulder, Phillips\u2019 group worked with three trauma therapy organizations to ensure that survivors and their families would not need to wait for government assistance or insurance approval to speak with a counselor.\n\u201cWe know that trauma therapy early on gives a huge difference in the ability to at least move forward in a healthy manner,\u201d Phillips said.\nLaura Wilson, a clinical psychology professor at the University of Mary Washington in Virginia, whose research has focused in part on survivors of mass shootings, said she is concerned that the pandemic is overlooked as a complicating factor.\n\u201cCommunity is a really powerful mechanism for recovery,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThe pandemic has complicated that because people can\u2019t get together; they can\u2019t safely hug someone outside of their household.\u201d\nWilson said the mental health community agrees that the most efficient therapies are cognitive processing therapy, which seeks to change negative beliefs and behaviors, and prolonged exposure therapy, in which a patient gradually confronts the cause of anxiety.\nWilson\u2019s research has shown that mass shootings \u2013 while representing just about 1% of gun deaths in the United States in any given year \u2013 have an outsized impact on the public at large.\nThose directly involved are most acutely affected, \u201cbut individuals across the country that don\u2019t personally know anybody impacted can experience a psychological reaction,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe see people posting on Twitter that their loved one was just going to buy milk, and the next thing they knew they were being shot at or killed, and that can impact anybody regardless of proximity to the event.\u201d\nColorado state Representative Tom Sullivan only recently embraced therapy to cope with the loss of his son Alex, who was murdered at the Aurora movie theater in 2012 on his 27th birthday. Sullivan poured his energies into activism and politics, pushing for stricter gun laws.\nMichael Morisette also channeled grief into activism after his daughter Kristina was murdered in the Borderline Bar and Grill shooting in 2018, when a gunman killed 12 people in Thousand Oaks, California.\nMorisette choked on his sobs as he spoke about his daughter\u2019s death at age 20 and his efforts to help other trauma victims. He left a retail sales job to become the California outreach coordinator for Give an Hour, an organization that provides no-cost mental health care.\nHe said family members of mass shooting victims \u201cneed peers who are walking alongside us, who have been through what we face.\u201d\nConi Sanders, whose father Dave was a teacher and basketball coach at Columbine and the lone adult killed, said her grief motivated her to become a therapist who works with violent offenders in the Denver area. She hopes to prevent future tragedies.\nShe said that mental health efforts following mass shootings focus on the immediate weeks afterward.\n\u201cBut for many people that does not fit. I didn\u2019t go to therapy until a few years after, which I found I couldn\u2019t cope by myself anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky journey, and support is needed at different times for years.\u201d",

        "article_body": "\nWASHINGTON\u00a0 \u2013 President Joe Biden said on Thursday the United States remained open to diplomacy with North Korea despite its missile tests this week, but warned there would be responses if North Korea escalates matters.\nBiden told his first White House news conference the suspected ballistic missile tests by Pyongyang violated U.N. resolution 1718, a 2006 measure through which the world body imposed sanctions on North Korea for missile and nuclear tests.\n\u201cWe are consulting with our allies and partners, and there will be responses if they choose to escalate. We will respond accordingly,\u201d Biden said.\n\u201cI\u2019m also prepared for some form of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization,\u201d he added, referring to the U.S. effort to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.\nShortly after Biden\u2019s remarks, the U.S. mission to the United Nations said the U.N. Security Council\u2019s North Korea sanctions committee would meet on Friday, at the request of the United States, to discuss the North Korean launches.\nThe move suggested a measured response by Biden\u2019s administration to the first tests since he took office in January, given that the meeting will be at a lower level than one held after North Korea last tested ballistic missiles a year ago.\nNorth Korea launched two suspected ballistic missiles into the sea near Japan on Thursday, underscoring steady progress in its weapons program and ramping up pressure on Biden\u2019s administration even as it reviews its North Korea policy.\nThe tests came just days after North Korea fired several cruise missiles in an exercise that Biden had played down as \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d.\nAsked if he agreed that North Korea was the top foreign policy issue he faced, Biden replied: \u201cYes.\u201d\nThe Biden administration says it is in the final stages of a policy review after former President Donald Trump\u2019s unprecedented engagement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which failed to persuade Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons.\nThe current administration has been simultaneously signaling a hard line on human rights, denuclearization and sanctions, while making diplomatic overtures that administration officials say have been rebuffed by Pyongyang.\nAnalysts say the North Korean tests were likely a response to joint U.S. and South Korean military drills and Blinken\u2019s recent visit to Japan and Korea, during which he criticized North Korea\u2019s human rights record.\nVictor Cha, a former White House official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said the scale of the North Korean tests had been measured so far compared with those at the start of the Obama and Trump administrations.\nCha said they could be a tactic aimed at extracting concessions for a return to the negotiating table.\nJoel Wit, a fellow with 38 North, a Washington-based North Korea monitoring project, said some observers had predicted North Korean might return to testing intercontinental ballistic missiles, something is has not done since 2017.\n\u201cThis falls far short of that,\u201d he said.\nJenny Town, the director of 38 North, said Biden\u2019s reference to denuclearization could explain why North Korea had ignored his administration\u2019s overtures.\nShe said his language ignored principles set out in a joint declaration agreed between Trump and Kim at their first summit in Singapore in 2018, \u201cthat gave equal priority to peace building, normalization of relations and working toward denuclearization.\u201d\n\u201cBringing the focus of negotiations back to solely the nuclear issue is a step backward in diplomatic terms,\u201d she said.\nBiden called Kim Jong Un a \u201cthug\u201d during his election campaign, and said he would only meet him \u201con the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity to get there.\u201d",

The United States should play a leading role in urging our partners and allies, including members of ASEAN, to take steps to cut off funding for the military,\u201d he said, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\nHuman rights groups welcomed the U.S. move but also urged more steps.\nHuman Rights Watch said the sanctions would create significant difficulties for the conglomerates in doing business with outside companies.\n\u201cThis is a very important step but it is not the biggest economic sanction that could be implemented,\u201d said the group\u2019s Asia advocacy director, John Sifton, adding that Washington should also target Myanmar\u2019s revenues from natural gas joint ventures with international companies.\nGlobal Witness urged the European Union to also impose sanctions on the military\u2019s business interests, and said Britain should follow the United States in targeting MEC.\nIn announcing the sanctions, the United States issued several licenses providing exemptions for official U.S. government transactions and those of international and nongovernmental organizations. One license authorized transactions necessary to wind down business involving MEC and MEHL or any entity they own, until June 22.",
